# PRC Block Library - Core Blocks

This primarily contains additional styles for `core/` blocks. Functionality should be added to the `prc-block-library-primitives` plugin, unless if they are specific to PRC needs. 

PHP classes for these blocks should be prepended with `core_` to easily identify that these blocks do not belong to us inside the `prc-block-library` plugin. 

### Contents:
- `core/cover` (TO MOVE INTO PRIMITIVES)
- `core/group`
- `core/heading`
- `core/image`
- `core/media-text`
- `core/navigation`
- `core/paragraph`
- `core/post-date`
- `core/post-title`
- `core/pullquote`
- `core/query`
- `core/seperator` (NOT IN USE CURRENTLY)
- `core/social-link` (TO MOVE INTO PRIMITIVES)
