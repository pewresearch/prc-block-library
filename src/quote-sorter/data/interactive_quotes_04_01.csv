You don’t have a chance to do that. Our sons still have opportunity that maybe the parents will send them to go to school. So, I think that we come, we Hmong in America, we have an opportunity to advance ourselves towards the things we want, or our goals.

Esther_Z,"ESTHER: My answer is based on your question, what does it mean to be a Chinese American? Three keywords. If you are a Chinese already in the United State, you have to struggle to survive and compete with others for resources. You may not need to get fully integrated into the society, but you have to adapt here to get what you want. For me, I would not say that it would be better or bad for personal development to stay in the United States, or return to the homeland, but that if this would be what I want, and I am able to make it, that would be good. Second is that as a Chinese, you are also an Ethnic Chinese. You have your own expertise. You will prove this [unclear source]. You may be in your home country, in economy, in various aspects, you will have some resources, as mentioned by Tina. You can use this expertise to serve as a bridge between the two countries, not only in culture, you can also make contributions in economic cooperation and political communication. From my own point of view, although this webinar is focused on the Chinese and Ethnic Chinese, I have always thought that all are equal. I should not think that because I am Chinese or Ethnic Chinese, I am inferior to others, I think all humans are the same, everyone is competing for resources. Maybe white people are the mainstream in the society now, but Hispanics and blacks, in all aspects, we will all become members of building this country ultimately.

Ethan_W,"ETHAN: The three words I wrote mainly correspond to the three points written by Tina, but it is only her last point that was better written than mine because I wrote “Choice”, she was like taking multiple aspects into account, so her answer is better than mine. In another aspect, I feel that as an Ethnic Chinese in the United States, when you mention the term “Ethnic Chinese”, it is easy to link it with another term “integration”, or even the two words “difficult integration”. I view this question in this way. Why are Chinese always associated with these words “hard to integrate”? I think it may be the genes in our Chinese culture. It is very difficult for the Chinese people. Chinese people always yearn for class mobility, or class rise. In this process, Chinese people are in the society of the United States. Why do they often ignore things unrelated to them? And why do they seem difficult to get integrated ostensibly. I don’t think it’s because the Chinese don’t want to fight for more interests. It is believed that the Chinese feel they are in their own way, in the most efficient way that they think to achieve the class rise in their minds. So, in this process, it is inevitable to trade off some superficial integration. So I don’t think this is a problem. I feel that this is the choice of the Chinese people.",foreignborn,under10yrs,#Chinese,#Male,#30-49,#income7,Mandarin,China,1st gen,5-10 yrs,Above $62k,$75k-$100k,2,30,NY,Boston,Suffolk,Some Postgraduate

Children can also snatch the phone from their father's hand that you are doing this wrong, it is not right for you to look at the phone. There is a big difference in the mindset or what we call cultural values here, and I think that is a very good thing that we can learn from these people here. There is another small thing, for instance, many people in India are not happy with marriage. But here people are fine with each other even after being separated. So this is the one thing that we probably don't know is right or wrong, are we right or are these people right. I am not saying that but the one ideology here to be happy, the effort is there, that is a very good thing. In India, as people remain unhappy, keep fighting, they do not separate, it is different. People here have a different thought process, so maybe it is better to have a harmonized mix of both.",foreignborn,under10yr,#Indian,#Male,#30-49,#income6,Hindi,India,1st gen,5-10,Below $62k,50-75k,3,36,NJ,Woodbridge,Middlesex,MA

One who wants to press from the upper and control, press most and make them work and the one who was pressed. Truth or not the truth, whatever they say. This is what we felt on the ground. To prove it, when you are poor, you are afraid and will work as demanded. So, give a farmer a farm. When the farm works well, when harvested, they become poor. When poor, you do what you have been demanded. Others rob what you harvest. And we live in Shan State, we know.

Are you Chinese or Japanese?”  Or sometimes kids would pull up the corners of their eyes or say stuff like “Ching Chong.”  And I’m from a pretty diverse part of the country too, so that’s messed up.  I mean, I know that they’re kids, and they don’t know any better, but at the same time, what are their parents teaching them at home for them to act like that?  I think, to me, why I answered people asking me if I’m this other ethnicity, it’s because that’s basically what’s happened to me the most often.  And, just more broadly, as an Asian person, I feel like there’s that stereotype that Asian students are high achievers academically.  They’re good at math and science and I actually went to a public high school that you needed to take a test to get into and it was considered really prestigious, but there I was a pretty mediocre student and math and science were actually my weakest subjects, so I feel like it’s either way you lose.  Teachers expect you to fit a certain stereotype and if you’re not, then you’re a disappointment, but at the same time, even if you are good at math and science, that doesn’t just mean that you’re fitting a stereotype.

Because the mainstream society is still white, in fact, the situation is the same as other ethnic groups such as blacks or Hispanics, and Ethnic Chinese is still aliens, still a minority. The second is that Chinese people have their own culture and also adapted to the current culture here, so their own traits are comparatively in the conflicts said by Ethan, I feel the same way. Third, because of the traits you bring, you have to look forward. What does the future hold for Ethnic Chinese and the society he lives in?

We do it starting from ourselves because it is inconvenient, hurts our back, kira falls down or gho gets left behind. Forget about a day, we cannot wear it for a moment. So this way, we are losing our culture. Even when it comes to Bhutanese cuisine, the most important dish is  curry, isn’t it? Now if we Bhutanese prepare it, no one prepares a pure dish. Neither do we include onion nor tomato. There are only chilis and cheese. This is just an example.

And I feel like that’s kind of unfortunate just because like it’s not that they would—it’s a bar, people go there to drink, have fun.  Same thing as like interracial dating, I feel like it’s so—in most elders it’s still like frowned upon.  And it’s kind of like unfortunate because I don’t think loving someone has to do with their skin; it has to do with like who they are as a person.  So for sure we are very cliquey.  Growing up, like I said, I only had four friends and they were Hmong.  So I think I too have to like contribute to that, but it will be nice to like get out of that little circle.

William_Y,"William_Y:  Sure, yes.  I think every culture is unique, every ethnic group is unique.  So I threw it out there, we are unique too in our own ways.  Just our struggles of how we migrated to the States, how we contributed to growing America, I think that’s very unique.  We are a very extremely family oriented ethnic group.  And like I shared with you earlier, I grew up with Filipinos, and Chinese, and Vietnamese and they don’t have that same structure or family bond like us Hmongs do, so I listed that as well.  And what else did I list?  I listed prideful and I agree with Va, cliquey.  I think the Hmong community, Hmong people are very prideful and cliquey, like what Va had just listed.  I don’t see that we’re open to making friends outside of our group for some odd reason.  And forgive me you guys, but like I said I grew up in a different world being from Chicago.  And I come here and if you go to Checker Bar, or Far East, or any of those bars, 99.9% are Hmong people and to me that’s weird.  Where are all the other ethnic groups?  How come they’re not coming to our bars?  How come they’re not coming to our restaurants?  How come they’re not coming to our sports festivals?

I’m over 60 years old now, so I feel the WWII is closer to me than younger people. When I talk to older people here, they often mention the war.
