You may not need to get fully integrated into the society, but you have to adapt here to get what you want. For me, I would not say that it would be better or bad for personal development to stay in the United States, or return to the homeland, but that if this would be what I want, and I am able to make it, that would be good. Second is that as a Chinese, you are also an ethnic Chinese. You have your own expertise.

I think it may be the genes in our Chinese culture. It is very difficult for the Chinese people. Chinese people always yearn for class mobility, or class rise. In this process, Chinese people are in the society of the United States. Why do they often ignore things unrelated to them? And why do they seem difficult to get integrated ostensibly. I donât think itâs because the Chinese donât want to fight for more interests. It is believed that the Chinese feel they are in their own way, in the most efficient way that they think to achieve the class rise in their minds. So, in this process, it is inevitable to trade off some superficial integration. So I donât think this is a problem. I feel that this is the choice of the Chinese people.',
