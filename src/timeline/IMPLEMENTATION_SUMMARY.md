# Timeline Block - Tick Mark Controls Implementation Summary

## Issue Resolution

This implementation addresses three key issues reported in the original issue:

### Issue 1: Lazy Loading (Not Addressed by This PR)

**Status:** Separate issue - handled by existing `disableLazyLoading` attribute in parent block
**Note:** The lazy loading issue is already handled by the `core-image` modifications that set `disableLazyLoading` to true for images inside timeline slides.

### Issue 2: ✅ Control Over Tick Marks

**Status:** RESOLVED
**Solution:** Added comprehensive controls to decide which tick marks are displayed:

- New `showAllTickMarks` toggle - Show all ticks or use interval filtering
- New `tickMarkInterval` control - Display every Nth tick mark (1-10)
- First and last ticks always visible for timeline boundaries
- Real-time preview in both editor and frontend

### Issue 3: ✅ Inconsistent Tick Mark Styles

**Status:** RESOLVED  
**Solution:** Added tick mark height control:

- New `tickMarkHeight` control - Set height in pixels (4-20px)
- Consistent default of 8px across all timelines
- Applied via CSS custom property `--tick-height`
- Ensures uniform appearance across all timeline instances

## Code Changes

### 1. Block Attributes (block.json)

```json
{
	"tickMarkInterval": {
		"type": "number",
		"default": 1
	},
	"tickMarkHeight": {
		"type": "number",
		"default": 8
	},
	"showAllTickMarks": {
		"type": "boolean",
		"default": false
	}
}
```

### 2. Inspector Controls (controls.jsx)

- Added "Tick Mark Controls" panel
- ToggleControl for "Show All Tick Marks"
- RangeControl for "Tick Mark Interval" (conditional)
- RangeControl for "Tick Mark Height"
- Added helpful descriptions for each control

### 3. Editor (edit.jsx)

- Added tick visibility filtering logic
- Applied CSS custom property for tick height
- Real-time preview of tick mark settings
- Maintains consistency with frontend rendering

### 4. Frontend Rendering (render.php)

- Reads new attributes
- Filters ticks based on interval setting
- Always includes first and last ticks
- Adds `visible` property to tick data
- Passes `--tick-height` CSS variable

### 5. Styles (style.scss)

- Added `.is-hidden` class for filtered ticks
- Uses `--tick-height` CSS custom property
- Maintains existing density-based rules

### 6. Interactivity (view.js)

- Added `isTickHidden` callback
- Checks `visible` property from context
- Applies `.is-hidden` class dynamically

## User Experience Improvements

### Before

- No control over which tick marks displayed
- Automatic density-based filtering only
- Inconsistent tick mark heights across timelines
- Editor didn't match frontend display

### After

- Full control via Inspector panel
- Manual interval selection (show every Nth tick)
- Toggle to show all ticks
- Consistent, configurable tick mark height
- Editor preview matches frontend exactly

## Example Use Cases

### Case 1: Long Timeline (1970-2025, 55 years)

**Settings:**

- Show All Tick Marks: OFF
- Tick Mark Interval: 10
- Tick Mark Height: 12px

**Result:** Shows 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, 2020, 2025 with 12px tall marks

### Case 2: Short Timeline (2020-2025, 5 years)

**Settings:**

- Show All Tick Marks: ON
- Tick Mark Height: 8px

**Result:** Shows all years (2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025) with standard 8px marks

### Case 3: Immigration Timeline (Custom Intervals)

**Settings:**

- Show All Tick Marks: OFF
- Tick Mark Interval: 5
- Tick Mark Height: 10px

**Result:** Shows every 5th year with 10px tall marks for better readability

## Backward Compatibility

✅ All existing timeline blocks continue to work without changes
✅ Default values preserve existing behavior:

- `showAllTickMarks`: false
- `tickMarkInterval`: 1 (shows all)
- `tickMarkHeight`: 8 (existing default)
