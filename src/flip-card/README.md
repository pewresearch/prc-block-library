# Flip Card

The Flip Card block allows you to create a card that flips over when clicked. It's comprised of a controller block, a front block, and a back block. The controller block is the block that is clicked to flip the card. The front and back blocks are the two sides of the card that contain content.


### @style-engine
Until PRC has been fully upgraded to use the style engine you can use these manual classes for borders:
```
has-black-border-color
has-gray-border-color
has-white-border-color
has-oatmeal-border-color
```


#### TODOs:
- [ ] add flip direction and speed attributes and controls to block.
